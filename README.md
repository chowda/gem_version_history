gem_version_history
===================

Rubygems version scraper built in ruby. After reading a post about doing something similar I thought I would try my hand
at it. It also gave me a good excuse to play with Ruby threading. I started out with a synchronous version that took about
3 hours and 15 minutes to run. After switching to a threaded approach it now runs in 15 minutes.
